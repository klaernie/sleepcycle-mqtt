# sleepcycle-mqtt
a bridge between the Sleepcycle App's PartnerLink and MQTT

## What does it do?
Sleepcycle offers on iOS the possibility to link with other people. They call this feature PartnerLink.

PartnerLink works by first publishing the iPhone/iPad's device name under the mdns service `_sleepcycle_ald._tcp.local.`.
So if your phone is called `Klaernie iPhone`the resulting mdns announcement would be for `Klaernie iPhone._sleepcycle_ald._tcp.local.`

This script now listens for these announcements, and when they are detected pushes a message with the value `ON` to an mqtt topic,
and also publishes a Homeassistant compatible autodiscovery entry.

## Configuration
As I intended to start this script via systemd I wanted to maintain the configuration in the systemd unit file as well.

Hence script requires two environment variables:
- `MQTT_SERVER` - the MQTT server it connects to
- `MQTT_TOPIC` - the base topic, under which it's status topics will apprear

## Limitations
- As this only runs locally, I did not feel the need to support TLS on the MQTT connection.
- Homeassistant discovery is non-configurable. I was just too lazy, so if you want it please send a PR.
- I bet there is a nice way to make the information pushed to Homeassistant more fleshed out.
- The environment variables don't have defaults in the code, only in the shipped service file
- A requirement is the `python3-zeroconf` package used. When I wrote this first it did not accept the mdns service name due to the disallowed `_` in the name. This may have changed by now.
